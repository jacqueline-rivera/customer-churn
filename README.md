# Objective
Customer attrition, or customer churn, is the percentage of customers that stop using a product within a given time frame. The first goal of this project is to identify important features that help determine if a customer will churn. The second goal of this project is to build a model that will predict if a customer will churn. 

# Data
The Telco Customer Churn dataset is utilized in this project and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn). This dataset contains 7,043 unique records with 21 features:
* Customer demographic features:
  * _customerID_
  * _gender_ - 'Male' or 'Female'
  * _SeniorCitizen_ - 1 if customer is 65 or older, 0 if not
  * _Partner_ - 'Yes' if customer has a partner, 'No' if not
  * _Dependents_ - 'Yes' if customer lives with dependents, 'No' if not
  
* Service options features:
  * _PhoneService_ - 'Yes' if a customer signed up for home phone service, 'No' if not
  * _MultipleLines_ - 'Yes' if a customer subscribed to multiple telephone lines, 'No' if not, 'No phone service' if not applicable
  * _InternetService_ - 'DSL', 'Fiber optic', 'No' if customer did not subscribe to internet service
  * _OnlineSecurity_ - 'Yes' if a customer subscribed for this option, 'No' if not, 'No internet service' if not applicable
  * _OnlineBackup_ - 'Yes' if a customer subscribed for this option, 'No' if not, 'No internet service' if not applicable
  * _DeviceProtection_ - 'Yes' if a customer subscribed for this option, 'No' if not, 'No internet service' if not applicable
  * _TechSupport_ - 'Yes' if a customer subscribed for this option, 'No' if not, 'No internet service' if not applicable
  * _StreamingTV_ - 'Yes' if a customer uses the internet service to stream TV, 'No' if not, 'No internet service' if not applicable
  * _StreamingMovies_ - 'Yes' if a customer uses the internet service to stream movies, 'No' if not, 'No internet service' if not applicable

* Customer account features:
  * _tenure_ - integer, the number of months the customer has been with the company
  * _Contract_ - 'Month-to-month', 'One year', 'Two year'
  * _PaperlessBilling_ - 'Yes' if the customer enrolled in paperless billing, 'No' if not
  * _PaymentMethod_ - 'Electronic check', 'Mailed check', 'Bank transfer', 'Credit card'
  * _MonthlyCharges_ - float, current total monthly charge for all services
  * _TotalCharges_ - float, current total charges calculated at the end of the quarter

* Target Variable:
  * _Churn_ - 'Yes' if customer left the company this quarter, 'No' if not

# Data Preparation
Checking the data types tells us that the _TotalCharges_ feature is of the object data type instead of float64:

```python
# check what is causing the object data type
print([x for x in data['TotalCharges'] if any(char.isdigit() for char in x) == False])
```
The code above revealed that there are 11 blanks in _TotalCharges_. These blanks were converted to NaN and then rows that contained null values were dropped. The resulting data frame contains 7,032 records.
